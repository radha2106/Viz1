    =IF(AND(***)......)
• Delete the unncessary rows based the results of the step above
• Add an index next the the date list.
• Get months texts
• Get months in colums::
	=TRANSPOSE(SORT(UNIQUE(TEXT(UNIQUE(data),"MMM")),1,1,1))
• Get agents ids in rows::
	=UNIQUE(data)
• Gave vacations after 1 year (check wages if has more than 12 months)
• Gave random date of NCNS to every agent (2-3 days)
  =RANDBETWEEN(data,data)
• Delete NCNS days to not get lost
• Gave random date of NCNS to every agent based on months (twice)::
	=RANDBETWEEN(MINIFS(data,data,data,data,data),MAXIFS(data,data,data,data,data)
• Create helper column for dayoffs:
	=INDEX(data,MATCH(data,data,0),MATCH(data,data,0)
• Add header to guide you on every column
• Add helper column for each dayoff separately::
	=OR(data=data,data=data)
• Add filters to headers and copy TRUE rows in NCNS file table
• Get unique NCNS if there is::
	=UNIQUE(data)
• Format dates to YYYY-MM-DD in the NCNS file
• Gave random quantity of emails depending of months and on wages:
	 Every new group:40min-48max (3ths months)
	 56min-72max (6ths months)
	 88min-96max (onward)
	=IFS(AND(data,data),RANDBETWEEN(data,data),AND(data,data),RANDBETWEEN(data,data),AND(data,data),RANDBETWEEN(data,data),AND(data,data),RANDBETWEEN(data,data),AND(data,data),RANDBETWEEN(data,data))
• Repeat agents and dates based on quantity values added
• Organize rows on sheets based on months
• Add info types (randomly) on columns 3 and foward::
	=INDEX($N$1:$N$9,RANDBETWEEN(1,ROWS($N$1:$N$9)))
