• Get dates from January to December (1/6-12/19 "last Friday"), filter the dates to only get Monday to Friday.
• Get months (as number from dates).
• Get agent's list names (including wave if needed).
• Repeat agent's name by the amount of dates.
• Repeat dates by the amount of agents repeated.
• Add index number to new list created.
• Filter agents based on hire date (this is to not include people on months that were not hired)::(if(months>=hired,1,0).
• Create 1 new sheet and get unique agent's name in rows and get unique months in columns.
• Gave random missing days to agents (1-3)::(randombetween).
• Gave random date of missing dates (index) to every agent based on months::(randombetween(minifs(),maxifs()).
• Repeat 2 last steps until missing days get to 0.
• Create helper column for 3 days missing::(index(,match(),match()).
• Create a helper column to filter is missing days are the same as the index date::(if(or(),1,0).
• Create 2 sheets; one for the missed days and another for the worked days.
• Delete the first sheets.
• Remove unnecessary columns from both of the sheets (only leave dates and agents, also need to lookup correct index for the dates instead of the ones added manually).
• Convert files separately to csv.
• Follow the other file called "Viz1 steps for call-chat-emails" to add how many rows of work will be added to work and repeat step #4
